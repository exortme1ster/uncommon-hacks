This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introducing coding duels

We were inspired by the leetcode, we think it is really hard to make something like that so we gave a shot! We are going to integrate this part to the [teameights](https://willowy-moonbeam-13cda4.netlify.app) soon. We did this project with NextJS, TS, Supabase and current version is able to compile code, support real time events and create users / tournaments


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
